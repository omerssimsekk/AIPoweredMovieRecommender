   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cinematch.git
   cd cinematch
   ```

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```

## How It Works

1. **Movie Search**: 
   - Enter the name of a movie in the search bar
   - Click search or press Enter

2. **Behind the Scenes**:
   - Gemini AI generates similar movie suggestions with explanations of why they're similar
   - TMDB API fetches the movie posters and details for visual display

3. **Results Display**:
   - Each suggestion shows up as a card with:
     - Movie poster from TMDB
     - Movie title and release year
     - Hover over a card to see why it's similar to your searched movie

## Usage

1. **Browse Popular Movies**: The scrolling ticker at the top displays popular movies. Click on any movie to see details or search for similar titles.

2. **Search for Movies**:
   - Enter a movie title in the search box
   - Click "Find Movies" or press Enter
   - The app will display your searched movie and AI-suggested similar movies

3. **Interact with Movie Cards**:
   - Hover over any movie card to see a brief overview and action buttons
   - Click on "Details" to see comprehensive information about a movie
   - Click on "Trailer" to watch the movie trailer on YouTube

4. **Movie Details**:
   - The details modal shows the movie poster, backdrop, overview, cast, and more
   - You can see why the AI recommended this movie
   - Access external links to TMDB and YouTube

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: If you see an API key notification at the top of the page, check your `.env` file to ensure your API keys are correctly configured.
- **No Movies Displayed**: Ensure your internet connection is stable as the app needs to fetch data from external APIs.
- **Server Won't Start**: Check if the port (default: 3000) is already in use by another application.
